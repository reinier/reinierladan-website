My [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is creating excellent digital products by managing product teams, designing user interfaces, and even developing prototypes. I've been doing that since the '90s, so I've got more than 20 years of experience in this field. Since 2016 I've focused all my time and energy on product management.

üè¢ I'm available as a freelancer to do remote work around the world from my own office. When you hire me in the area of Amsterdam, I'd also like to work on-site.

üåé The world is changing. Business, people, technology, everything is changing faster and faster. That's why I focus on an agile way of working like Scrum and Kanban. To get stuff done in such an environment, you have to align with your team members and have a shared vision for your product and service. It's my job as a product owner/manager to get everybody on the same page and work on the most critical problems to solve and objectives to reach.

üë®‚Äçüíª With my experience in both design and software engineering, I can help the product team explore viable solutions. The thing that motivates me the most is diving into the nitty-gritty details of problems and objectives and figure out why they exist and what has to be solved first to get the most value for the business and the customer/user.

üí´ I had the pleasure to work with a lot of great companies and create pretty awesome products at Schiphol, Funda, Liberty Global, NOS, NPO, FOX Sports, and many others.
