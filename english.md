My [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) is creating excellent user experiences by management, design and even development work. I've been doing that since the '90s so I've got 20+ years of experience in this field. Since 2016 I've focussed all my time and energy on product management.

🏢 I'm available as a freelancer to do remote work around the world from my own office. When you hire me in the area of Amsterdam, I'd also like to work on-site.

🌎 The world is changing. Business, people, technology, everything is changing faster and faster. That's why I focus on an agile way of working like Scrum and Kanban. To get stuff done in such an environment, you have to align with your team members and have a shared vision for your product and service. It's my job as a product owner/manager to get everybody on the same page and work on the most critical problems to solve and objectives to reach.

👨‍💻 With my experience in both design and software engineering, I can help the product team explore viable solutions. The thing that motivates me the most is diving into the nitty-gritty details of problems and objectives and figure out why they exist and what has to be solved first to get the most value for the business and the customer/user.

💫 I had the pleasure to work with a lot of great companies and create pretty awesome products at Schiphol, Funda, Liberty Global, NOS, NPO, Sanoma, RTL, NRC, FOX, Eredivisie, Adformatie, Nederlandse Taalunie, KNSB, and many others.
